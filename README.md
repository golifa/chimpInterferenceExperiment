## Overview

This repository contains the code and datasets for the Master’s thesis investigating whether chimpanzee faces interfere with human holistic face processing. The study used a category-interleaved one-back task, and data were analysed to examine potential cross-species interference effects. No evidence for interference was found under the current experimental conditions.

*Keywords:* holistic processing, cross-species face processing, composite effect, chimpanzee faces

## Stimuli Sources

### Human Composite Stimuli

The human face stimuli were sourced from Rossion's laboratory database, comprising 36 composite faces (21 male and 15 female) [Rossion 2013](https://face-categorization-lab.webnode.page/resources/).

### Chimpanzee Composite Stimuli

The chimpanzee face stimuli were created from photographs sourced from [Mollison and Goodall (2005)](https://www.jamesmollison.com/shop/p/james-other-apes-1). Six chimpanzee identities generated 36 aligned and 36 misaligned composite faces. Preprocessing included: <br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cropping: To an oval shape <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grayscale Conversion: Standardisation of color <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resizing: 350 × 350 pixels in BMP format <br>

Aligned composites recombined tops and bottoms of different Chimpanzees with a ~2% gap. Misaligned composites shifted the bottom half horizontally by ~32% (112 pixels), disrupting spatial configuration while preserving featural information.

## Setup Instructions

### Python

1. **Install dependencies**
In your terminal or PyCharm environment, run:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3. **Extract datasets** <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unzip datasets.zip in the root folder.

3. **Edit dataset path in chimper.py** <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Make sure the script points to the extracted datasets folder.

4. **Run the experiment**
   ```bash
   python src/chimper.pyt

### R

1. **Install required packages** <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In R or RStudio, run the commands in packages.R.

2. **Run the analysis** <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Open src/chimpAnalyser.R and execute it to analyse the CSV result files generated by the experiment.

### Notes

- Ensure Python and R scripts are run from the **root repository folder** to preserve relative paths.  
- The Python experiment logs outputs to timestamped text files using `loggingUtils.py`.  
- All results should be stored in the same folder as the experiment CSV outputs **before running the R analysis**.
