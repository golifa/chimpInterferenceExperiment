## Overview

This repository contains the code and datasets for the Master’s thesis investigating whether chimpanzee faces interfere with human holistic face processing. The study used a category-interleaved one-back task, and data were analysed to examine potential cross-species interference effects. No evidence for interference was found under the current experimental conditions.

*Keywords:* holistic processing, cross-species face processing, composite effect, chimpanzee faces

## Setup Instructions

### Python

1. **Install dependencies**
In your terminal or PyCharm environment, run:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3. **Extract datasets** <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unzip datasets.zip in the root folder.

3. **Edit dataset path in chimper.py** <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Make sure the script points to the extracted datasets folder.

4. **Run the experiment**
   ```bash
   python src/chimper.pyt

### R

1. **Install required packages** <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In R or RStudio, run the commands in packages.R.

2. **Run the analysis** <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Open src/chimpAnalyser.R and execute it to analyse the CSV result files generated by the experiment.

### Notes

- Ensure Python and R scripts are run from the **root repository folder** to preserve relative paths.  
- The Python experiment logs outputs to timestamped text files using `loggingUtils.py`.  
- All results should be stored in the same folder as the experiment CSV outputs **before running the R analysis**.
